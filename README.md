## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Pixel Drawing" project aims to provide users with an interactive website for generating and drawing pixel art graphics. The application enables the creation of unique pixel art designs that can be used in various contexts such as video games, graphic design, or as a creative hobby.

### Features Description:

- **Pixel Art Drawing:** Users can create pixel art graphics using various drawing tools.
- **Templates:** Ability to use ready-made templates for a quick start.
- **Gallery:** Store and view previously created projects in a gallery.
- **Sharing:** Option to share projects on social media platforms or download them to a local device.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Pixel Art Drawing:** Users can use various drawing tools like brush, eraser, fill tool, etc.
- **Templates:** Availability of ready-made templates that users can modify.
- **Gallery:** The application stores the history of created projects, allowing users to browse and reuse them.
- **Sharing:** Users can share their creations on various platforms or download them locally.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Ease of Use:** The user interface should be friendly, intuitive, and easy to use.
- **Performance:** The application should run smoothly and respond quickly to user actions.
- **Aesthetics:** The interface and generated graphics should be aesthetically pleasing and meet pixel art style expectations.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Homepage:_ Control panel with drawing options, templates, access to the gallery.
- _Drawing Window:_ Area for creating graphics with drawing tools and project preview.
- _Gallery:_ Browse and manage previously created projects.

### Site Map:

- _Homepage_
  - Control panel
  - Drawing options
  - Gallery
- _Drawing Window_
  - Drawing tools
  - Project preview
- _Gallery_
  - List of previously created projects
  - Option to share and download

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data of created projects, including:

- **Drawing Parameters:** Contains information about the tools and settings chosen by the user.
- **Projects:** Stores the created project along with its details.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC structure, where:

- **Model:** Responsible for the drawing logic and project management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python).
- **Database:** SQLite (storing project data).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for drawing logic, interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style:_ Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of drawing and project management functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure components work correctly together.
- **User Interface Tests:** Verify user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate the performance of drawing under various parameters.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing detected bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, publication on platforms available to users.
- **Timelines:** Set dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Execution Stages:** Divide tasks into specific tasks (e.g., implementation of drawing tools, interface, testing).
- **Timelines:** Determine the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on work hours or the development team's rates.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, possible external service fees, technical support.
